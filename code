Shipley's is in Texas. Shipley's makes Krispy Kreme seem like child's play, an ammateur in the world of donuts. Needless to say Shipley's is delicious. Texas is the greatest state in the nation. </p>

A Dunkin Donut is a disgrace. Krispy Kreme saves lives. Shipley's creates life as one has not truly lived until she has eaten a warm, freshly baked Shipley's donut. Dunkin Donuts is a joke. I laugh at its feeble donut attempts.  </p>
